A new release has been in the works for a while now, with 11 incomplete songs being currently worked on, hopefully for a release in autumn. Some of the working titles include, in alphabetical order:<br /><br />\"Anthromorph\", \"Impulse\", \"Infra Red Seekers\", \"Lord of Worms\", \"Memoirs of A.I.\", \"Ominous Dawn\", \"Perdition\", \"Rift Vision\", \"System Boot Failure\", \"The Core\", \"Wasteland Roamers\"<br /><br />While waiting for that, the winds of change tear down the foundations and thus a new site is built on the ground zero of old.

Depending on how well the shirt sells, there may also be a second type of t-shirt later on for diversity.<br /><br />During this time, I've been preparing all the background tracks for most of the songs from the three latest albums for possible live gigs this fall/winter. But first we need to rehearse the songs with Kraken during the summer and also see if it's feasible to perform with just two guys. If there's gigs, they will most likely be in this area (Tornio-Kemi-Oulu, maybe Rovaniemi) and perhaps in Sweden (Haparanda, Luleå¡¡nd maybe Umeå©® I will also try to record those gigs and see how it works. Maybe put out a live album for fun, or just have them available for download.

I'll keep writing more songs until the end of October, or early November. Then I'll start going through the songs and picking which ones will be on the album and doing any changes needed to the other songs. After that I'll start working on the lyrics, which should be done around early December or so, hopefully. In January, it's once again time to start recording the final songs. The vocal recording sessions should be fun with mobile equipment now at my disposal.<br /><br />Here's some quick run-throughs of the songs so far, in alphabetical order with working titles for songs, the final names will be decided after the lyrics are done:<br /><br /><b>Afterworld</b> (3:54) [234 bpm]<br />Quite a fast song that starts out with a deceiving melody before lashing out. The first chorus is quite an evil sounding one, followed by a very old school Swedish death metal style main chorus.<br /><br /><b>Astral Breed</b> (3:58) [145 bpm]<br />A midtempo song with a mysterious main verse. The second part takes up the first space shuttle available. The chorus is a very sneaky one combining trance with a black metalish slower guitarline.<br /><br /><b>Bleak Expectations</b> (4:52) [220 bpm]<br />Starts out with some synth work, followed by some technical riffage with more black metal touches. The chorus is very melodic with lots of synth stuff and arpeggios. The C part contains black metal and more space-synths, with a nice solo spot later on.<br /><br /><b>Humanity: Static</b> (5:41) [156 bpm]<br />Very driving song all around, with lots of electronics and synths. A nice mystical and evil sounding chorus. Could be the album opener.<br /><br /><b>Posthumanism</b> (3:54) [256 bpm]<br />Extremely fast stuff, with a nice twisted melody-riddled chorus and lots of time signature changes. Very futuristic sound. Another candidate for an album opener.<br /><br /><b>The Wolves</b> (4:39) [157 bpm]<br />Starts out with an oriental style shredfest, followed by a futuristic setting going towards a very electronic chorus. Lots of heavy riffs.<br /><br /><b>Transcendence</b> (3:31) [157 bpm]<br />The first song composed after Deep Beneath. Nice and futuristic with a nice drive. The chorus may get a small change, but at the moment it's got a nice melody going on. The C-part features completely over the top drum machine work.<br /><br /><b>Xenomorphosis</b> (4:17) [244 bpm]<br />Fast stuff with a very futuristic feeling, fans of the original Need for Speed soundtrack will feel at home, especially during the chorus. Relentless song.<br /><br /><br />There you go for the time being!",

And at that, I also re-composed a lot of the drumming from Conclusion and Wasteland. The drums still play mostly the same base beats, but with different fills and such, and sometimes different beats altogether. A lot of the songs have new synths added too, and in a few cases there's all new synth work in the songs that didn't have any on the album (Their Contract and Winds of Contamination, most prominently). So, you'll hear much new stuff in the live renditions of the songs :)<br /><br />I still need to finish a few more songs, though, but it shouldn't take long.

Okay, let's see. These are in alphabetical order:<br /><br /><b>Chaos Dimension</b><br />A bit slower (in Vortech scale :D) with lots of melody and synths, but the chorus goes down a dark path towards (you guessed it!), chaos feel in the first two appearances of the chorus, with a nice lead line replacing the grand piano in the remaining choruses. Imagine opening a door and stepping out to a thunderstorm.<br /><br /><b>Charcoal Earth</b><br />The quick intro leads you right into a melodic black metal kind of chorus, followed by a melancholic verse part where the synths take the stage. Soon the mood goes towards darkness... I think the verse has a lot of Need for Speed II/III intro music feel. A bit more experimental in the later parts of the song. Overall somewhat lush, but uneasy in mood.<br /><br /><b>Demon In the Circuitry</b><br />The first song written for the upcoming album. Starts with some tentative blasting, leading into a mysterious verse. The chorus lets it loose, leading back to a Millennium era FLA-like dark thingy. On the second time, the chorus gets a nice lead addition, much in Deep Beneath spirit. Then it's time to stop and hammer down an intense breakdown with lots of processed synth.<br /><br /><b>Frozen Machine</b><br />The most extreme song I've done for Vortech. All out black metal at 262 bpm with lots of mountain-high orchestral synths, ridiculous shredding rhythms and a desperate lead guitar line. And back to some more fireworks and leads. And some more muscular blasting :P A brief slow part, picking up the pace in no time, leading into the snowstorm of a chorus. Think of Anthems to the Welkin at Dusk, taking place in the future...<br /><br /><b>Neurovirus</b><br />The future is grim indeed, in a bit more thrash-like song, with a nice twist. Fear Factory goes Meshuggah? A bit eastern in the chorus, followed by a melodic post-chorus. Then it's blast-time, and back to some tricksy palm mutes.<br /><br /><b>Pyre of Souls</b><br />Now this is an interesting piece. And yes, this song was written before Devin released Addicted! :) An upbeat, very industrial metal song in pure mid-90's Waltari style, but with some twisted melodies. This song is actually compiled of some excellent outtake riffs from the Posthumanism sessions, that didn't fit into the other songs, but sounded great on their own. Get your ass shakin' :D<br /><br /><b>The Apocalypse</b><br />What else would a song with a title like that be? Blastbeat and shr... well, actually it's a doom metal song :D From 262 bpm down to 80 bpm! Very slow and haunting, with more synths than your average doom song, but that's what experimentation is about ;) Think of H.P. Lovecraft in song form. Very eerie, mysterious and dark. Quite a different style than the other songs, and it's possibly the album ending song.<br /><br /><b>The Black Rite</b><br />A monster of a chorus! Very epic and grand, plus heavy of course. Somewhat more in the progressive vein of Deep Beneath, but with more synths and devilish melodies. One of my favourite songs of these eight, and will end up in our live set for sure. It already sounds like an excellent song to end a show with!<br /><br /><br />So there you go, a quick description of the songs finished so far. I will keep writing songs until new year or so, including some ambient stuff again, and there's also a few unfinished songs left to complete. Overall, I think there will be 15 songs from which I will select the final 10-11 songs for the album. Should be a nice continuation to the Vortech timeline! No idea of when it will be finished, but more than likely it will be spring 2010 or so, as usual ;)",

I think I once described the song as Arcturus goes Testament.<br /><br /><b>Charcoal Earth</b><br />Energetic opening, with a melancholic verse slightly in Need for Speed II soundtrack style. End-time song and mood.<br /><br /><b>Demon In the Circuitry</b><br />The first song that was finished. Quite dark and driving, with an uplifting slightly egyptian chorus. A hard-hitting electronic interlude.<br /><br /><b>Frozen Machine</b><br />High-speed black metal with lots of electronics. You can hear the demo version on our <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/vortechmetal\">Myspace</a> page. Maybe even slightly orchestral, but highly dark in the chorus.<br /><br /><b>Grains of Reality</b><br />Dark electro. Slightly ambient but very expressive. Ulver? Even darker. Will most likely be the album ending song.<br /><br /><b>Lost</b><br />Some more black metal, this time a bit more straightforward. Still some dark melodies and a bit of speed. The kick drums really take advantage of being a machine ;) Something like 364 bpm...<br /><br /><b>Neurovirus</b><br />The first song to be played live from the album. Kind of Meshuggah-ish. Electronics, low tuning and some tricks. A really fun song.<br /><br /><b>Pyre of Souls</b><br />Perhaps a small homage to mid-90's Waltari. It's actually made out of riffs that didn't fit the past two albums, but still sounded good. This time they did, when combined. Get your butt movin' and groovin'!<br /><br /><b>Shattered Cities</b><br />Very industrial, with sample-based drums and electro beats. Quite dark overall, part of this song was going to be in a fully drum & bass type of song. Eventually the song developed into this one. New Breed?<br /><br /><b>The Apocalypse</b><br />Very slow doom metal with synths and a piano. Haunting and eerie with a highly fitting title. Perhaps the last song on the album. <br /><br /><b>The Black Rite</b><br />Probably the album opening song. High-paced and energetic, with a nice mood. Very melodic chorus, with sudden black metal changes.<br /><br /><b>Unveiling the Future</b><br />Punk/Hardcore? With a slight blackish touch, â­¡ Zyklon, but really something I haven't heard before anywhere. No blastbeats! ;)<br /><br /><b>Wire Synapse</b><br />Slightly fast with more hardcore things and electronics. Maybe a little SYL-like chorus, but darker. A lot of space synths in Darkspace style.<br /><br /><br />Will the album be called \"Devoid of Life\", time will tell ;) The artwork has progressed well. Once all the changes are complete to the demo songs, it's time to select which songs will be on the album. Not all of them will be.",

I have first chosen a selection of 16 tracks from the history of Vortech, and then I have decided a completely different music genre that I will use as a guideline for the remaking of each song :) In every case, completely different than what the original was. <br /><br />Once this special release is ready, you will hear, for example, a black metal version of Apoapsis Mentis, a lounge/orchestral version of Humanity: Static, a dubstep/industrial version of Evolutionary Project, a jazz version of Terra Ultimatum, drum & bass version of The Core, a dark ambient version of Biodroid Legions, and many many more equally interesting remakes! And maybe a few surprises too...<br /><br />And as a final bonus, here is a quick sneak preview on what is to come! ;) Enjoy!<br /><br /><a href=\"http://koti.mbnet.fi/juhau/vortech/evoremix.mp3\">Evolutionary Project (Debased World Order Remix by Vortech)</a>",

Well, from the first songs and rough material, it is very different to Posthumanism and the 2011 album. Much more electronic and more ambient in general, but still with lots of guitars ;) We think three albums of blastbeats should do for the time being, so don't expect a lot (if any) of them on the 2012 album. The style is more futuristic, beat-oriented with industrial ambience.<br /><br />It's all very inspiring at the moment, so the 2012 album should progress well in the upcoming months :)",

They will be printed CDs, instead of factory-made CD-R discs.<br /><br />3) The T-shirts for Devoid of Life will be ordered as soon as I get replies to the quote requests, and then we will decide which company we will use. The shirts should be quickly available after that, and they will be available for purchase through our website and hopefully some other places.<br /><br />4) Live shows and rehearsals. We will continue our rehearsals at least until we have a nice setlist working well, and then we will start looking forward to playing some concerts around Finland, and hopefully soon abroad too!<br /><br />5) The next Vortech band album. Of course being planned already! I already have some ideas for the style and such, and I'm sure many will be pleased to know it will be a really fast one, hehe. Scifi and all... For sure it will be ready by the end of 2013, but who knows maybe even earlier.<br /><br />6) We are also trying out some extra members for the band, although currently perhaps just for live shows.

As mentioned, this album is highly electronic/industrial-oriented in the approach and expands the palette of Vortech to whole new levels!<br /><br />I've always likened the style of Vortech as a triangle where each corner has one of the three aspects: 1) Extreme Metal, 2) Industrial and Electronic, and 3) Progressive. Looking back, Deep Beneath leaned a lot towards the Progressive corner, while for example Posthumanism was in the Extreme corner along with Wasteland. This brand new album will be a case where the flag is hoisted firmly in the Industrial and Electronic corner.<br /><br />We will also work on a second album this year, which will be in the more familiar Vortech grounds of Industrial Death Metal. But at the moment, the full effort is given for this electronic metal album, which has the working title \"The Binary Hive\". We will now begin to go through the songs to pick a suitable tracklist and do any adjustments to the songs if needed. The lyrics will also be written during this time, and once everythings ready, we will start to record the album!<br /><br />That's it for the mean time!<br />- Juha",

        "A Whole Lotta Music", "The results of a very busy first half of the year are in! At the moment, 14 new songs are fully demoed, with a couple of more in the works (a few ambient pieces...), but I am still aiming to write some more songs before we will begin the usual process of converting the demos into an album!<br /><br />But, not to keep you in too much suspense, here are the songs so far with a short description of each. They are listed in alphabetical order:<br /><br /><b>Battling With A Lion</b> (160 bpm)<br />A futuristic re-imagination of the old demo track. Lots of ambience. Quite energetic!<br /><br /><b>Blast Radius</b> (225 bpm)<br />The song title says it all! An explosion of speed and fury, in a tightly packed powerhouse of a track. Get your industrial death metal grooves out! Just like in the mid-90's...<br /><br /><b>Disconnect</b> (210 bpm)<br />A dynamic mixture of blistering melodies and experimental verses. A view to the bitter dawn of a brave new future world. Ends with some nice synchronized madness between the kicks and guitars.<br /><br /><b>From the Void Arise</b> (172 bpm)<br />More horror-styled mood, with some melancholic dark melodies. Slightly in the style of Posthumanism, but not quite as fast.<br /><br /><b>Ghosts of Existence</b> (284 bpm)<br />Now, if you thought Frozen Machine was ridiculously fast, check this out! Perhaps humanely impossible drums (Ville?), but all the more fun! Just sheer cold and (dark)spaced out black metal - until the end. Ohh, the end will leave you hanging on the edge... Did I mention the song is 7 mins 33 seconds long?<br /><br /><b>Industrial Complex, Pt. 1</b> (134 bpm)<br />And now for something completely different! Slightly looking back to our previous album, but more befitting the mood of this album in general. Dark industrial with some twisted grooves and chugging. Back to the mid-90's, Part 2. Good times!<br /><br /><b>Internal Poison</b> (240 bpm)<br />Melodic, fast and heavy. Classic Vortech style with some of the fastest triple picks ever for the band! Trying out some new ways to play keys/synths, and very dark industrial melodies. Originally written with a keyboard!<br /><br /><b>Neolithic (The Darkness Is Born)</b> (175 bpm)<br />Another darker piece, re-constructed from two unfinished songs for the previous album. I can almost hear some Swedish influences here and there, but you will recognize it's us for sure!<br /><br /><b>Oceans of Steel</b> (218 bpm)<br />One of my supreme favourites of the demos! Extremely energetic, industrialistic and heavy! Prepare for a rainy futuristic mid-part of pure dark beauty!<br /><br /><b>Predictable End</b> (147 bpm)<br />Even more industrial metal than most. Another energetic piece of sheer catchy heaviness! Oriental industrial? Anachronism, much? Trying out some strange new drum beats, and guitarless parts.<br /><br /><b>Proximity</b> (137 bpm)<br />Industrial Motörhead? Who knows, but this is sheer darkness in industrial metal shape. Expect some more epic synth pads, and a heavy chorus!<br /><br /><b>Strength In Numbers</b> (132 bpm)<br />Take a journey into the space industrial-complex! Very melodic, crunchy and futuristic to the bone! With some experimental synths and segues into fast parts. Quite a fun song, and very atmospheric!<br /><br /><b>The Empty Vessel</b> (189 bpm)<br />Experimenting with samples and sound FX will sometimes lead into full songs! That's the story of this little piece that brings you heavy riffs! Simple but effective piece of madness! With a very nice breakdown to bring the enjoyability to the max!<br /><br /><b>Within the Fog</b> (260 bpm)<br />Also a re-recording of an older outtake. This one from the Wasteland days! The song was ultimately unfinished and was left out of the album. Now's your chance to hear it in the modern days! Fast, traditional and with new atmospheric synths!",

        "Nearing a decade as Vortech!", "As you might know, the name of the band changed to Vortech in late 2005, and we are steadfastly closing in on a decade as such. Perhaps that will lead to some special festives, but this will be seen in the future. However, one thing is for sure. There will be more music coming at a usual pace, and here's how I foresee the next few years:<br /><br /><ol><br /><li>We are soon ready with demoing the songs for the next full length album, with a working title of \"...of What Remains\". This album is more on the familiar style of Industrial Death Metal, like the Vortech you know best. Should all go well, this album might be out by the end of the year 2014, but it's all down to drum recording schedules. Ville will play real drums once more on the album with Mikko on vocals, and I will of course handle the other instruments. Expect an album closer to the style of Posthumanism than our previous releases.</li><br /><li>Playing live is a target for us, and we have been rehearsing more actively this year, with a small summer break for personal reasons. We are on the lookout for opportunities to play live once more, and have a steady selection of 13 songs to pick from.</li><br /><li>Should our finances allow for it, we will certainly work on getting Posthumanism and The Occlusion released on factory pressed CDs with full casing and artwork. Another goal is to have a few more t-shirt designs available, and possibly other merchandise (feel free to drop requests on FB!)</li><br /><li>If you are a fellow musician, you can also send a message to us and we'll see if there's a chance for collaboration or a guest appearance on our albums! It's always fun to see how others interpret our material, so remixes and such are also more than welcome!</li><br /></ol><br /><br />So, looking forward to the next years!<br /><br />- Juha / Vortech",

The total duration of all the new songs is 1h 23m of extremely Vortech-y stuff!<br /><br />The next step for us is to start picking the songs for the album (10-11 total probably) and working on the song order. This time there is no central theme to the lyrics, so what we are planning to do is to split up the album in two \"sides\", with some ambient stuff inbetween. Then Mikko and me (Juha) will write lyrics to one side per person. Let's see what this results in!<br /><br />All in all, the songs remind me a lot of the experimental edge of Wasteland, and the scifi melody and speed of Posthumanism! Very nice! Of course, with 20 songs to choose from, there will be lots of leftovers this time. We will see what happens with them - perhaps a special release of non-album tracks in digital form?<br /><br />And here are the working titles of all the songs now, in alphabetical order:<br /><br />Battling with a Lion<br />Blast Radius<br />Decay to Static<br />Disconnect<br />From the Void Arise<br />Ghosts of Existence<br />Industrial Complex<br />Internal Poison<br />Neolithic (The Darkness Is Born)<br />Oceans of Steel<br />Predictable End<br />Proximity<br />Quantum Dissolution<br />Signal Loss<br />Singularity<br />Strength In Numbers<br />The Empty Vessel<br />Toxin Release<br />Underutilized<br />Within the Fog<br /><br />Stay tuned!

        "Plans for 2016", "So the year has started off and some of you might notice it's a special year! It marks the 10th anniversary as Vortech, and it's also the equal anniversary of our first full length!<br /><br />This year will have two special releases:<br /><br />1) A brand new mix of Devoid of Life, which has been requested every now and then. It is actually already done, with some small tweaks left to do, and then it will be released as a digital-only version. More news on that soon!<br /><br />2) The motherlode: A \"Best of\" type of album consisting of <b>COMPLETELY</b> re-recorded AND newly mixed songs spanning all albums, except for Devoid of Life, which will have a new mix, as mentioned above, and the newest album ...of What Remains. There will also be some minor changes to the songs here and there, based on how we have rehearsed and played live. The songs from our electronic album, The Occlusion, will be re-written as traditional songs with drums and all. The plan is to have Mikko record all the vocals, but we'll see if there's any guest vocals...<br /><br />The re-recorded album has a working title of \"Refactored\" and the plan is to have the following songs in chronological order - the actual release will probably have them in a mixed order, almost like a new album. <br /><br />Mind Awakening<br />Sycophant Gods<br />The Core<br />Evolutionary Project<br />Instigate Hostile Reaction<br />Radiant Storm<br />Biodroid Legions<br />Bewildered<br />Xenomorphosis<br />Destined to Fall<br />The New Creations<br />Afterworld<br />Shedding the Flesh<br />Charcoal Earth<br />Mechanicide<br />Sparks of Ignition<br />Below Radar<br /><br />This will be an exciting project for sure! All the songs will feature a very pristine modern production and with upgraded synth sounds etc.<br /><br />And of course there's some new demo songs being done here and there for the next full length album. The album will probably be ready in 2017, though.<br /><br />Stick around!",

More on that in a video coming up later on!<br /><br />So, what is next? After the drum pulses are ready, it is of course time to implement the actual drums for the songs. Then will come some bass, followed by guitars and vocals.  All the synth parts are ready now and have been exported as final versions.<br /><br />There is also a very nice and cohesive concept that was conjured for this album and the story will progress along with the songs into something that ends in dust :) It is still a skeleton layout, but will receive a firm coat of steel around it in the upcoming times.<br /><br />So, officially, the recording process has started!
